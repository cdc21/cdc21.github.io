## Who Said Anything About Software Engineering?
  The funny thing is, I did not switch majors to computer science every planning or dreaming to be a software engineer. Alas, ICS314 is a required class to graduate. My interests lie more in machine learning and data science; although, there are a few things that pique my interests in the realm of software engineering and software development. I would love to learn how to make a website from scratch. I am talking no help, no ChatGPT, no Youtube videos, just what I learn from this class. Is it possible? I'll see about that. On another note, website development is very interesting as the idea of millions, if not billions, of people are/will access a certain website all at once. I find it intriguing how websites don't crash nor do they ever slow down (for the most part). The deeper layers of how websites work is something I am very interested in and would like to know more about as this class progresses.  


## Dr.SWE: The Best Code-lift Money Can Buy
  A skill that I would like to develop in software engineering would be about the aesthetics of a website. I believe the way a website looks is just as important as how functional it is. Design and functionality go hand in hand with one another. This intertwined relationship is something I would like to explore in depth during my software engineering journey. The formatting, the layout, the color are all things that I would like to learn how to do. Front-end development and the aesthetics of a website are skills I would like to start to develop and build. 


## The Dream Team In A Buggy Reality
  An experience I would like to develop would be working in a team setting where people actually contribute. I know software engineering requires a team effort (and maybe a whole football team too) but being apart of a team where I am able to contribute meaningful work would be something I would look forward too in this journey. The fire of ideas with the fuel of collaboration would be a dream to be apart of. Being apart of team that could possibly change the world with technology and innovation is something I hope to come across one day.

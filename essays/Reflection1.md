## So Is It Javascript or Javachip?

  Javascript is a very powerful language that utilizes very familiar concepts from languages that I already know. Javascript is very reminiscent of Java but with less specificity in the code. Getting started with Javascript and being able to code and run my first program took no time at all. However, a few specific aspects of Javascript that seem to be the same as other languages are not, which is quite confusing. For example, to initialize a for loop, you have to use the let keyword instead of int. The minute details are hard to remember but not impossible. 


## Spike, Get, and Set with Javascript!
  The learning curve for Javascript compared to C and C++ is quite low and is very easy to learn. Getting started and being able to create a simple program is very easy if you already have prior knowledge of coding in any other language. Javascript has the look of Java in terms of code but with the functionality and feel of Python, in my opinion. It is quite enjoyable to learn and to type code without thinking of all the specificities as Javascript takes care of that for you. As for learning something new, getter and setter methods in classes are a new concept for me. Being able to specify actions of reading and writing in code for objects is unique. 


## Two Peas In A Programming Pod
  Javascript as a preferred language for software engineering seems to be a good choice as it is very versatile. The way it is structured and its attributes make coding very easy which is important when developing software. It works around many errors other languages would have, such as different return types for functions and not having to declare the data type for variables. Javascript being able to handle the little details makes working with web applications very easy as the web is very volatile as input could be anything. 

## Now Lets Get Real...
  Athletic software engineering seems to not be the best way to learn because it encourages rushing, brushing over details, and finding shortcuts that may be detrimental. However, I do believe that it develops critical problem solving skills and tries to promote efficiency. The practice WODs aid in this as you are able to practice as many times as you want until you get it right. By being able to do it multiple times, it helps you realize certain mistakes that can be fixed and certain areas that could use improvement. As for the format, this reverse classroom situation is quite irritating actually. If I am able to do most, if not all of the learning at home, why is it an in-person class in the first place? However, it is very fun when you have an engaging professor and it is nice being able to collaborate with other students.

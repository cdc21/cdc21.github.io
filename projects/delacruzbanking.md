Dela Cruz Banking is a project that I created as a project in ICS212, Fall 2023. This project was the culmination of what I learned in class and helped me learn about different programming structures. 

Dela Cruz Banking was implemented in the terminal using the progamming language C first, and in the coming weeks, was translated and reimplemented using C++. Within a month, I created a banking program using both C and C++. 

This project helped me gain experience in 2 new languages and the use of the MacOS Terminal. I got hands-on experience using a command-line interface using text-based commands on the uhunix servers.
